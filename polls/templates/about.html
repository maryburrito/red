    <p class="card-text">Talk About Periods was started as a school project, but it has quickly become more
      than just a grade. The purpose Of Talk About Periods is to help end the stigma around menstruation by creating a
      space where people can learn about menstruation and become inspired to start a conversation. Join us and Talk
      About Periods!</p>
