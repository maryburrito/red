            Not everyone can afford periods products every month. This can lead to adolescents missing school, to unsanitary measures, and countless other problems. Every menstruator deserves to have access to period products on their period.

        Instead of using terms like women or females when talking about menstruation, try to be more inclusive by using the term ‘menstruator’ - not all menstruators are female, nor are all females menstruators.

      <p class="heading">"The Tampon Tax"</p>
      <p class="explain">
          The tampon tax is a tax in some states that regards feminine products as non-necessities thus making them subject to a value added tax Some states have taken the initiative and repealed the tax, but it still exist in the majority of US states. States are making money by taxing feminine hygiene product, when they are a necessity.  This needs to end. Feminine products are a necessity and should not be taxed as a luxury. 
          The tax increases the price on these products and makes affording monthly period supplies even harder for more people. The government is making money of a monthly need in some point in the life of about half the population. 
          <a href="https://www.freethetampons.org/tampon-tax.html" target="_blank">Free the tampons</a>has great information on the tampon tax as well advocating for free menstruation products in public restrooms.
